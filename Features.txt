Add OnBoardingScreen by using the react-native-swiper package
Will need react-native-async-storage to keep track of the onBoarding in order to only load it once 

Fetching data from sanity, in this case requires the full query graphql style and also to get the image
I need to access the url store in the asset property 

To create the search functionnality 
-I need to apply the filter on the pool of item, and return the items that contain/include the text inputed*
-And have to do a conditionnal rendering based on state of the filter, i.e if no filter render the whole data fetched
